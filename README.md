# Our Mission
Eating healthily on a budget is a big challenge for many students. Our project will address the lack of a centralized platform combining healthy recipes with local discounts and sales, to specifically target university students on a limited budget. We hope to close the gap between students' convenience, cost, and affordable healthy eating by developing a web-based application.

# Features
- Weekly meal plans catered to individual dietary requirements and budgets
- Multiple suggestions and nutrition information for recipes
- Individualized shopping lists with anticipated costs from local grocery stores
- Local supermarket discounts/sales display based on user location (zip code)
- Display of overall savings while using our web application (obtained by contrasting the initial projected expenses with the actual costs following the application of discounts)
