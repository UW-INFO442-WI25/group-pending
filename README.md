# Our Mission
Eating healthily on a budget is a big challenge for many students. Our project will address the lack of a centralized platform combining healthy recipes with local discounts and sales, to specifically target university students on a limited budget. We hope to close the gap between students' convenience, cost, and affordable healthy eating by developing a web-based application.

# Features
- Weekly meal plans catered to individual dietary requirements and budgets
- An ideal meal plan featuring breakfast, lunch, and dinner, complete with recipes, step-by-step instructions, and detailed nutrition information.
- A grocery page where users can filter and view specific on-sale items with ease.
