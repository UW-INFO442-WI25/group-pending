I enjoy the flavor of toasted oats in granola bars, so that's why I gave the oats more oven time.In a large bowl, snap the pretzel sticks into small pieces with your hands. Don't worry if the pretzel bits are different sizes--we're not striving for perfection here.Toss in the sliced almonds and chocolate chips and stir. Once the rolled oats are toasted, add them to the bowl. The chocolate chips will start melting, which is exactly what you want. If you prefer eating whole chocolate chips, wait until the rolled oats have fully cooled off before mixing with chocolate",
